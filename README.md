## 👋 Hey there, I'm Arlie! 

🎓 I'm a Software Engineering student at **Telkom Schools**! Passionate about code, design, and anything tech-related.  
🛠️ I'm that person who likes experimenting with stuff, even if it means breaking it just to fix it better.

---

### 🚀 Currently Learning
- Crafting full-stack web apps with **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML/CSS** (JS in progress, LOL)
- Still learning how to use Laravel and stuff... so difficult :(
- Loving my role as a QA in programming. Sometimes Front-End, sometimes QA, LOL
- Running custom ROMs, modding Androids, and taming VMs
- Virtual machines explorer (VMware, VBox, Hyper-V) & OS tinkering (Android x86, Windows, Linux, even macOS 👀)
- Exploring OS interfaces. Yeah, I care about the vibes too

---

### 🎯 Hobbies & Interests
- 👨‍💻 Coding mini projects for school... and just for fun, I guess
- 🎮 Casual Minecraft gamer (Java + Bedrock squad). I play both
- 📱 Into old-school tech: collecting iconic phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 1, Tizen phones, and others
- 🎧 Music junkie: Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, Adele, and more
- 🧠 Big fan of Windows UI history! From 95 to 11, I've seen it all
- 🖥️ Also loves experimenting with macOS and Linux distros (via VMware VMs)

### 💡 Fun Fact
I *literally* downgraded a Galaxy Note 1 back to Android Gingerbread (kinda).
Why? For the ✨TouchWiz aesthetic✨. It’s not just nostalgia, more like a lifestyle 😎
(Technically Android ICS, but the TouchWiz UI is still similar to Gingerbread)
