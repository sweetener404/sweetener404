## 👋 Hey there, I'm Gabriel!

🎓 I'm a Software Engineering student at **Telkom Schools**! Passionate about code, design, and anything tech-related.  
🛠️ I'm that person who likes experimenting with stuff, even if it means breaking it just to fix it better.

### 🚀 Currently Learning
- Crafting full-stack web apps with **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML/CSS/JS**
- Getting comfy with **Git & GitHub** (version control = sanity)
- Running custom ROMs, modding Androids, and taming VMs
- Exploring OS interfaces. Yeah, I care about the vibes too

---

### 🎯 Hobbies & Interests
- 👨‍💻 Coding mini projects for school... and just for fun
- 🎮 Casual Minecraft gamer (Java + Bedrock squad)
- 📱 Into old-school tech: collecting iconic phones like the Samsung Note 1, Tizen phones, and others
- 🎧 Music junkie: Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, Adele, and more
- 🧠 Big fan of Windows UI history! From 95 to 11, I've seen it all

### 💡 Fun Fact
I *literally* downgraded a Galaxy Note 1 back to Android Gingerbread (kinda).  
Why? For the ✨TouchWiz aesthetic✨. It’s not just nostalgia — it’s a lifestyle 😎
